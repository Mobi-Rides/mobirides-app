# Fix: Align Use of Funds in Valuation Framework

## Problem
The Use of Funds breakdown in `docs/MobiRides_Valuation_Framework_06-02-2026.md` (Section 8.1) does not match the approved allocation in the Commercialization Plan and Advisory Meeting Agenda.

## Current (Incorrect) — Valuation Framework
| Category | Allocation |
|----------|-----------|
| Payment integration | 40% |
| Android launch | 25% |
| SADC expansion prep | 20% |
| Operations | 15% |

## Corrected — Per Commercialization Plan & Advisory Agenda
| Category | Allocation | Amount |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Team building | 60% | P420K |
| Technology & infrastructure | 15% | P105K |
| Marketing & user acquisition | 12% | P84K |
| Operations & working capital | 13% | P91K |

## Change Required
Update **one line** in `docs/MobiRides_Valuation_Framework_06-02-2026.md` (Section 8.1, Investment Summary table) to replace the incorrect use of funds with the approved breakdown.
