**mobirides/mobirules** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository for Mobirides car-sharing platform development.

Here are the development guidelines:

- ðŸ”­ **Currently working on:** Production-ready car-sharing platform for Botswana
- ðŸŒ± **Currently learning:** Advanced React patterns, Supabase real-time features, Mapbox integrations
- ðŸ‘¯ **Looking to collaborate on:** Payment gateway integration (Stripe/Botswana providers), file storage optimization
- ðŸ¤” **Looking for help with:** Production deployment, transaction atomicity, notification systems
- ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about:** React 18 + TypeScript, Supabase RLS policies, Mapbox mapping, car rental workflows
- ðŸ“« **Project structure:** 75% production ready, critical gaps in payments/file storage
- ðŸ˜„ **Tech stack:** React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, Mapbox
- âš¡ **Fun fact:** Built with AI assistance using Trae Rules for consistent code quality

## Development Rules

### Code Quality Standards
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Follow React Hook rules strictly
- Maintain 100% ESLint compliance
- Use Supabase RLS for security

### Framework-Specific Guidelines
- **React:** Functional components with hooks only
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom components
- **Database:** Supabase with proper TypeScript types
- **Maps:** Mapbox with Botswana-specific configurations
- **Payments:** Stripe integration with local providers

### AI Behavior Customization
- Prioritize car rental domain knowledge
