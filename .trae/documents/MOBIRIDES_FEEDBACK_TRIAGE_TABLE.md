## Recent Updates (October 8, 2025)

### ✅ Conversation Visibility Fix
- **Issue:** Users (especially admins) couldn't see conversations where they were participants but not creators
- **Root Cause:** Overly restrictive RLS policy on `conversations` table only checked `created_by = auth.uid()`
- **Solution:** Updated RLS policies to allow users to see conversations where they are either creator OR participant
- **Impact:** Critical messaging functionality now fully operational
- **Documentation:** See `docs/conversation-visibility-fix-2025-10-08.md` for detailed analysis
