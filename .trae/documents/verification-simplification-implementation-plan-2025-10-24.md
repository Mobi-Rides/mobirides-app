## 🚨 Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Items

#### Risk 1: Data Loss During Migration
**Probability:** Medium | **Impact:** Critical  
**Mitigation:**
- Create full database backup before migration
- Test migration on staging with production-like data
- Implement atomic transactions (rollback on failure)
- Run migration during low-traffic window
- Monitor error logs in real-time during migration

#### Risk 2: Users Mid-Verification Lose Progress
**Probability:** Low | **Impact:** High  
**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive step mapping logic (7-step → 3-step)
- Preserve all uploaded documents in migration
- Send notification to affected users about flow change
- Provide support documentation for users with issues
- Add "Need help?" link on verification page

#### Risk 3: Storage Bucket Permission Issues
**Probability:** Medium | **Impact:** High  
**Mitigation:**
- Test RLS policies extensively before production

- Monitor storage access logs for unusual patterns
- Implement retry logic for transient storage errors
- Have rollback plan to revert bucket policies

### Medium-Risk Items

#### Risk 4: Admin Confusion with New Progress Display
**Probability:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Provide admin training session before launch
- Add tooltip explanations on progress indicators
- Create admin FAQ document
- Show migration version badge prominently
- Implement gradual rollout (admins see both flows temporarily)

#### Risk 5: Mobile Camera Access Issues
**Probability:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Test camera permissions on all major mobile browsers

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

### Rollback Triggers
- Migration success rate <95%
- User completion rate drops >10%
- Critical bugs affecting >5% of users
- Storage bucket permission errors >2%
- Admin panel unusable

### Rollback Steps

**Phase 1: Immediate Stop (15 minutes)**
1. Stop deployment, freeze all code changes
2. Disable new 3-step flow via feature flag
3. Revert to old 7-step flow for all users
4. Notify engineering team via incident channel

**Phase 2: Database Rollback (30 minutes)**
1. Stop database migration script if running
2. Execute rollback SQL script:
   ```sql
   -- Revert migration_version to NULL
   UPDATE user_verifications 
   SET migration_version = NULL 
   WHERE migration_version = 'v2';
   
   -- Restore old step values (from backup table)
   -- Restore old progress calculations
   ```
3. Verify data integrity with test queries
4. Restore database from backup if corruption detected

**Phase 3: Code Rollback (30 minutes)**
1. Revert Git commits to last stable version
2. Redeploy previous version of frontend/backend
3. Clear CDN cache for affected pages
4. Verify old flow works correctly in production

**Phase 4: Storage Cleanup (1 hour)**
1. Remove new storage buckets (if no data uploaded)
2. Revert storage RLS policies to previous version
3. Archive any uploaded documents to backup location

**Phase 5: Communication (Ongoing)**
1. Send status updates to stakeholders every 30 min
2. Post incident report in team channel
3. Notify affected users via email if data affected
4. Schedule post-mortem meeting within 24 hours

### Rollback Testing
- [ ] Test rollback procedure on staging environment
- [ ] Document rollback steps in runbook
- [ ] Train on-call engineers on rollback process
- [ ] Verify database backup restoration works
- [ ] Test feature flag toggle (instant revert)

## 📅 Deployment Strategy

### Phased Rollout Plan

#### Phase 1: Internal Testing (2 days)
- Deploy to internal staging environment
- Team members test full flow (10+ test runs)
- Fix any critical bugs found
- **Go/No-Go Decision Point**

#### Phase 2: Beta Users (3 days)
- Enable for 5% of new verification starts
- Monitor metrics closely (hourly checks)
- Collect user feedback via survey
- **Rollback if success rate <85%**

#### Phase 3: Gradual Rollout (5 days)
- Day 1: 20% of new verifications
- Day 2: 40% of new verifications
- Day 3: 60% of new verifications
- Day 4: 80% of new verifications
- Day 5: 100% of new verifications
- **Monitor at each stage, pause if issues detected**

#### Phase 4: Migration of Existing Users (1 day)
- Run migration script for users mid-verification
- Send email notifications about flow change
- Monitor support tickets for migration issues
- **Rollback if error rate >5%**

#### Phase 5: Full Production (Ongoing)
- 100% of users on new 3-step flow
- Continue monitoring for 2 weeks
- Collect user feedback and satisfaction scores
- Plan iterative improvements based on data

### Feature Flag Configuration
```typescript
// Feature flag for gradual rollout
const useSimplifiedVerification = () => {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  const rolloutPercentage = 5; // Start with 5%
  
  // Hash user ID to get consistent experience
  const userHash = hashUserId(user.id);
  return userHash % 100 < rolloutPercentage;
};
```
