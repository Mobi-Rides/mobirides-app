## Archive Rationale

### Phase Reports (Completed Work)
These reports document **completed** excellence phases from Q3-Q4 2025. They represent significant milestones in the platform's maturity but are no longer actively referenced in current development priorities.

### Status Reports (Historical Data)
Status reports from September-October 2025 and December 2024 have been replaced by more recent November 2025 reports. They provide historical context but are not relevant to current execution.

### Superseded Plans (Strategy Evolution)
- `ACTION_PLAN.md`: Created earlier, now replaced by the comprehensive `ROADMAP-NOV-DEC-2025.md` which provides more detailed execution timelines and priorities.
- `COMPREHENSIVE_PROJECT_COMPLETION_ANALYSIS.md`: High-level analysis replaced by weekly status reports with actionable metrics and specific task tracking.
