## 1. Executive Summary

MobiRides is Botswana's first peer-to-peer car-sharing and Rent2Buy marketplace platform. This document presents three independent valuation approaches to justify a **P6,000,000 (≈$451,000 USD) pre-money valuation** for the company's pre-seed round of P700,000.

All three approaches converge on a valuation range of **P6.0M – P12.5M**, establishing P6.0M as a conservative floor. This valuation is further supported by comparable fundraising transactions across the African mobility ecosystem, where startups at similar or earlier stages have raised at significantly higher implied valuations.

**Key Conclusion:** A P6.0M pre-money valuation represents a **discount to fair value**, offering investors an attractive entry point into a validated, first-mover platform with a multi-market SADC expansion roadmap.

---

## 3. Valuation Approach 1: Modified Berkus Method

### 3.1 Methodology

The Berkus Method assigns value to five key risk-reduction categories in pre-revenue or early-revenue startups. We apply a **Modified Berkus** calibrated for emerging-market, multi-market opportunity startups. Each category is valued up to **P1,500,000** (reflecting the SADC-scale opportunity vs. the traditional $500K USD cap used for single-market US startups).

### 3.2 Valuation Build-Up

| Risk Category | Evidence | Value Assigned |
|--------------|----------|---------------|
| **1. Sound Idea (Market Risk)** | First P2P car-sharing platform in Botswana; no direct competitor in SADC; 380M+ addressable population; dual-product (P2P + Rent2Buy) | **P1,500,000** |
| **2. Working Prototype (Technology Risk)** | 85% complete production platform; 47+ database tables; real-time messaging; Mapbox navigation; 7-step handover; insurance integration; mobile app in progress | **P1,200,000** |
| **3. Quality Management Team (Execution Risk)** | Founder-led with domain expertise; operational in Botswana; strategic advisory board being formed; demonstrated ability to ship complex features | **P900,000** |
| **4. Strategic Relationships (Market Risk)** | Trillo fleet partnership (anchor supply); Pay-U insurance integration; DPO/Paygate payment rails; CIPA trademark | **P1,200,000** |
| **5. Product Rollout / Early Traction (Production Risk)** | P311K revenue (305% growth); 56 active vehicles; validated unit economics (60:1 Host LTV:CAC); proven demand in 4 Botswana locations | **P1,400,000** |
| | **TOTAL** | **P6,200,000** |

### 3.3 Berkus Method Conclusion

**Implied Valuation: P6,200,000** — directly supports the P6.0M pre-money target.

## 4. Valuation Approach 2: Cost-to-Recreate + IP Premium + Expansion Optionality

### 4.1 Methodology

This approach calculates the replacement cost of recreating MobiRides' technology, data, and market position from scratch, then applies premiums for proprietary IP and multi-market expansion optionality.

### 4.2 Component Valuation

#### A. Technical Platform Replacement Cost

| Component | Estimated Cost to Recreate |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| Core platform (React/TypeScript/Supabase, 47+ tables, RLS policies) | P600,000 |
| Authentication, KYC & verification systems | P200,000 |
| Real-time messaging with encryption architecture | P250,000 |
| Booking engine with conflict detection & dynamic pricing | P200,000 |
| 7-step handover system with photo documentation | P250,000 |
| Mapbox integration (navigation, geolocation, route planning) | P150,000 |
| Insurance schema & claims management | P150,000 |
| Admin dashboard & super-admin controls | P150,000 |
| Wallet, commission & payment infrastructure | P150,000 |
| Email system, notifications & real-time subscriptions | P100,000 |
| Mobile app architecture (Capacitor) | P100,000 |
| **Subtotal: Technical Platform** | **P2,300,000** |

#### B. IP & Intangible Assets

| Asset | Value |
|-------|-------|
| CIPA registered trademark (legal exclusivity) | P200,000 |
| Proprietary 7-step handover protocol (operational moat) | P300,000 |
| Rent2Buy marketplace architecture (TAM expansion) | P250,000 |
| Pay-U insurance partnership integration | P150,000 |
| **Subtotal: IP Assets** | **P900,000** |

#### C. Data & Market Position

| Asset | Value |
|-------|-------|
| 12+ months proprietary demand/pricing data | P300,000 |
| First-mover brand recognition in Botswana P2P market | P200,000 |
| Established host/renter network (56 vehicles, active users) | P200,000 |
| **Subtotal: Data & Market Position** | **P700,000** |

#### D. Expansion Optionality Premium

The platform is architected for multi-market deployment. Each new SADC market represents incremental value with marginal additional cost (localisation, payment rails, regulatory compliance).

| Market Optionality | Value |
|-------------------|-------|
| Zambia expansion option (Year 2) | P500,000 |
| Namibia expansion option (Year 2) | P500,000 |
| Mozambique/Angola expansion option (Year 3) | P500,000 |
| Mauritius expansion option (Year 4) | P400,000 |
| Additional SADC markets (Year 5) | P400,000 |
| **Subtotal: Expansion Optionality** | **P2,300,000** |

### 4.3 Total Valuation (Cost-to-Recreate)

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Technical Platform | P2,300,000 |
| IP & Intangible Assets | P900,000 |
| Data & Market Position | P700,000 |
| Expansion Optionality | P2,300,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **P6,200,000** |

### 4.4 Cost-to-Recreate Conclusion

**Implied Valuation: P6,200,000** — An investor would need to spend at minimum P6.2M to recreate what MobiRides has built, ignoring the 18+ months of execution time and market learning.

## 5. Valuation Approach 3: Venture Capital Method (Multi-Market)

### 5.1 Methodology

The VC Method works backward from a projected exit valuation, applying a target return multiple to derive today's pre-money valuation.

### 5.2 Revenue Projections (5-Year, Multi-Market)

| Year | Markets | Vehicles | Bookings | Revenue/Booking | Annual Revenue |
|------|---------|----------|----------|----------------|---------------|
| Year 1 | Botswana (4 cities) | 150 | 4,200 | P168.75 | P1,368,000 |
| Year 2 | + Zambia, Namibia | 500 | 14,000 | P175.00 | P4,900,000 |
| Year 3 | + Mozambique/Angola | 1,200 | 33,600 | P180.00 | P12,096,000 |
| Year 4 | + Mauritius | 2,500 | 70,000 | P185.00 | P25,900,000 |
| Year 5 | 6–7 SADC markets | 5,000 | 140,000 | P190.00 | P53,200,000 |

*Note: Revenue per booking increases modestly due to insurance attach rates and Rent2Buy premium transactions.*

### 5.3 Exit Valuation Scenarios

| Scenario | Year 5 Revenue | Revenue Multiple | Exit Valuation |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Conservative** | P53.2M | 5x | P266,000,000 |
| **Base Case** | P53.2M | 8x | P425,600,000 |
| **Optimistic** | P53.2M | 12x | P638,400,000 |

*Revenue multiples benchmarked against African mobility exits (Moove at 6.5x ARR at Series B; regional tech M&A at 5–12x).*

### 5.4 Pre-Money Derivation

| Scenario | Exit Value | Target Return | Implied Pre-Money |
|----------|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| Conservative (5x, 25x return) | P266M | 25x | **P10,640,000** |
| Base Case (8x, 30x return) | P425.6M | 30x | **P14,187,000** |
| Optimistic (12x, 40x return) | P638.4M | 40x | **P15,960,000** |

*Target returns of 25–40x are standard for pre-seed in emerging markets.*

### 5.5 VC Method Conclusion

**Implied Valuation Range: P10.6M – P15.9M** — Under all scenarios, the P6.0M pre-money valuation represents a **significant discount** to fair value, offering investors 1.8x – 2.7x more upside than typical pre-seed terms.

### 6.3 Comparative Analysis — MobiRides vs. Peers at Pre-Seed

| Metric | MobiRides (Now) | Treepz (Pre-Seed 2020) | Moove (Seed 2020) | Gozem (Seed 2021) | FlexClub (Seed 2021) |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Revenue** | P311K ($23.4K) ✅ | Minimal | Pre-launch | Minimal | Pre-revenue |
| **Revenue Growth** | 305% ✅ | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Working Product** | 85% complete ✅ | MVP | Concept | MVP | MVP |
| **Active Fleet** | 56 vehicles ✅ | N/A | 0 | N/A | N/A |
| **Unit Economics** | Validated (60:1 LTV:CAC) ✅ | Unvalidated | Unvalidated | Unvalidated | Unvalidated |
| **Markets** | 1 (expanding to 5+) | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 |
| **Implied Valuation** | **P6.0M ($451K)** | ~P66.5M ($5M) | ~P1.06B ($80M) | ~P199.5M ($15M) | ~P266M ($20M) |

**Key Insight:** MobiRides is raising at a **fraction** of what comparable African mobility startups raised at similar or earlier stages — often with less traction, no revenue, and unvalidated unit economics. The P6.0M valuation represents a **13x–176x discount** to peer valuations at comparable stages.
