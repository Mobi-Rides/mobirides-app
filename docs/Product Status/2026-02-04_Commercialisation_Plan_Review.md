# MobiRides Commercialisation Plan Review
**Date:** February 4, 2026  
**Status:** Draft for Review  
**Purpose:** Align projections with FY2025 actuals before updating main Commercialization Plan

---

## Overview

This document proposes a structured, bottom-up approach to align the Commercialization Plan with FY2025 historical actuals. We will work in three phases:

1. **Phase 1:** Update projections based on FY2025 actuals
2. **Phase 2:** Derive unit economics from the new projections
3. **Phase 3:** Align marketing budgets with projections and unit economics

This approach ensures all figures are grounded in actual Botswana market data rather than theoretical USD-based estimates.

## Phase 1: Align Projections with FY2025 Actuals

### Current FY2025 Baseline Data

| Metric | FY2025 Actual |
|--------|---------------|
| Total Revenue | P311,245.05 |
| Monthly Average Revenue | P25,937 |
| December 2025 Revenue | P54,000 |
| Q4 2025 Growth | +145% vs Q1 |
| Gross Margin (Fleet Model) | 24.5% |
| Target Gross Margin (P2P) | 65%+ |
| FY2025 Marketing Spend | P5,173 |

### Revised Revenue Projections

**Building from Q4 2025 Momentum:**

Using December 2025 (P54,000) as the baseline and applying realistic growth rates:

| Month | Revenue (BWP) | MoM Growth | Calculation Basis |
|-------|---------------|------------|-------------------|
| Month 1 (Jan 2026) | P60,000 | +11% | Dec baseline + organic growth |
| Month 2 | P69,000 | +15% | Marketing ramp begins |
| Month 3 | P79,000 | +15% | Continued momentum |
| Month 4 | P95,000 | +20% | Marketing fully operational |
| Month 5 | P114,000 | +20% | Growth phase |
| Month 6 | P137,000 | +20% | Growth phase |
| Month 7 | P171,000 | +25% | Mobile app launch boost |
| Month 8 | P214,000 | +25% | Mobile adoption |
| Month 9 | P267,000 | +25% | Peak mobile impact |
| Month 10 | P320,000 | +20% | Stabilization |
| Month 11 | P384,000 | +20% | Holiday season |
| Month 12 | P461,000 | +20% | Year-end peak |
| **Year 1 Total** | **P2,371,000** | | |

### Commission & Revenue Breakdown

**At 65% P2P Margin:**
- Platform commission (15% of GMV): P355,650
- Insurance attachment (20% of bookings × P120 avg): ~P57,000
- **Total Year 1 Platform Revenue: ~P2.43M**

### GMV Calculations

If platform commission is 15% of GMV:
- Year 1 GMV = P2,371,000 / 0.15 = **P15.8M**

### Year 2 Projections

Starting from Month 12 baseline (P461,000) with 15% average MoM growth:
- **Year 2 Total Revenue: ~P12-15M**

## Phase 2: Derive Unit Economics from Projections

### Current Issues (Still in USD in Main Document)

Lines 1020-1082 and 1947-2056 use theoretical USD figures that don't match Botswana market realities.

### Revised Unit Economics (BWP)

#### Average Booking Value

| Metric | Value | Calculation |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| FY2025 Avg Booking | ~P778 | P311,245 / ~400 bookings |
| P2P Model Avg Daily Rate | P450 | Market research |
| Average Rental Duration | 2.5 days | Historical data |
| Average Booking Value | P1,125 | P450 × 2.5 days |
| **Platform Commission/Booking** | **P168.75** | P1,125 × 15% |

#### Host CAC (Based on Botswana Channels)

| Channel | CPM (BWP) | Conversion Rate | Cost per Signup |

| Facebook/Instagram | P30-50 | 2% | P750-1,500 |
| Google Ads | P60-80 | 3% | P1,000-1,800 |
| Referral | P500 flat | 15% | P500 |

- Cost per host signup: P750-1,500
- Activation rate (host lists car): 20%
- **Cost to Activated Host: P3,750-7,500**
- **Conservative Host CAC: P5,000**

#### Renter CAC (Based on Botswana Channels)

| Channel | CPM (BWP) | Conversion Rate | Cost per Signup |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Facebook/Instagram | P30-50 | 4% | P150-300 |
| Google Ads | P60-80 | 5% | P200-350 |
| Referral | P200 flat | 20% | P200 |

- Lower friction than hosts
- Social ads + Google: P150-300 per signup
- Activation to first booking: 40%
- **Cost to First Booking: P375-750**
- **Conservative Renter CAC: P600**

#### Host LTV

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average lifespan | 18 months (conservative) |
| Bookings per month | 3 (realistic for Botswana) |
| Commission per booking | P168.75 |

## Questions for Review

### Phase 1: Projections
1. Is 11-25% MoM growth realistic given Q4 2025 momentum?
2. Should we adjust the December 2025 baseline (P54,000)?
3. Is Year 2 target of P12-15M achievable?

### Phase 2: Unit Economics
1. Are LTV:CAC ratios of 1.7-1.8:1 acceptable? (Industry standard is 3:1+)
2. Should we adjust host/renter lifespan assumptions?
3. Are Botswana-specific channel costs accurate?

### Phase 3: Marketing
1. Is P420,000 sufficient for Year 1 growth targets?
2. Is the 60/10/10/10/5/5 channel split appropriate?
3. Should campaign budgets be redistributed?

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Review and validate FY2025 December baseline figure
2. [ ] Confirm Botswana-specific CAC assumptions
3. [ ] Validate LTV assumptions against actual retention data
4. [ ] Approve revised projections
5. [ ] Update main Commercialization Plan document
