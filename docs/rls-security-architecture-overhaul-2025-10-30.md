# **MobiRides RLS & Security Architecture Overhaul - Implementation Plan**

**Document ID:** MOBI-SEC-2025-001  
**Date Created:** October 30, 2025  
**Priority:** CRITICAL (Security Vulnerability)  
**Estimated Duration:** 3-4 weeks  
**Total Story Points:** 89 SP  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation

---

## üìä **Executive Summary**

This document provides a comprehensive Jira-style implementation plan to address **CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES** and architectural conflicts in the MobiRides RLS (Row Level Security) policies. The current implementation allows privilege escalation attacks and blocks core community features due to overly restrictive or conflicting policies.

### **Critical Issues Identified**

1. **üî• SECURITY VULNERABILITY**: `profiles.role` column enables privilege escalation to admin
2. **üö´ Conversation Blockage**: Only creators can view conversations (blocks messaging UX)
3. **‚ö†Ô∏è 80 RLS Linter Issues**: Including 4 ERROR-level security definer warnings
4. **üîÑ Duplicate Policies**: 30+ overlapping/redundant policies causing conflicts
5. **‚ùå Missing Role Management**: No separate `user_roles` table (security best practice violation)

### **Business Impact**

- **Security Risk**: Any user can escalate to admin by updating their profile
- **UX Blockage**: Message recipients cannot see conversations sent to them
- **Performance**: Redundant policy evaluations slow down queries
- **Maintenance**: Conflicting policies make debugging extremely difficult

### **Solution Overview**

4-phase migration plan addressing security, community features, policy consolidation, and testing:

| Phase | Focus | Duration | Story Points | Risk |
|-------|-------|----------|--------------|------|
| **Phase 1** | Critical Security Fix | Week 1 | 21 SP | HIGH |
| **Phase 2** | Community Features Unblocking | Week 1-2 | 26 SP | MEDIUM |
| **Phase 3** | Policy Consolidation | Week 2-3 | 21 SP | LOW |
| **Phase 4** | Testing & Validation | Week 3-4 | 21 SP | LOW |

**Story ID:** MOBI-SEC-111  
**Story Points:** 8 SP  
**Priority:** P0 - CRITICAL  
**Assignee:** Backend Team Lead  
**Sprint:** Sprint 1, Week 1

**User Story:**
> As a **system administrator**, I need a secure role management system that prevents privilege escalation, so that only authorized personnel can perform admin operations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] `app_role` enum created with values: `user`, `admin`, `super_admin`
- [x] `user_roles` table created with proper foreign keys
- [x] RLS enabled on `user_roles` with restrictive policies
- [x] `has_role()` SECURITY DEFINER function created and tested
- [x] Function bypasses RLS without triggering recursive checks
- [x] Existing admins migrated from `profiles.role` and `admins` table
- [x] Zero errors during migration

**Technical Tasks:**

```sql
-- Task 1.1.1: Create app_role enum (1 SP)
CREATE TYPE public.app_role AS ENUM ('user', 'admin', 'super_admin');

CREATE TABLE public.user_roles (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
    role public.app_role NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE (user_id, role)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_user_roles_user_id ON public.user_roles(user_id);

-- Task 1.1.3: Enable RLS on user_roles (1 SP)
ALTER TABLE public.user_roles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Task 1.1.4: Create restrictive RLS policies (2 SP)
CREATE POLICY "Only super admins can manage roles" 
ON public.user_roles FOR ALL 
USING (
  EXISTS (

    AND role = 'super_admin'
  )
);

-- Task 1.1.5: Create SECURITY DEFINER function (2 SP)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.has_role(_user_id UUID, _role public.app_role)
RETURNS boolean
LANGUAGE sql
STABLE
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = public
AS $$

AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM profiles 
        WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role::text IN ('admin', 'super_admin')
    );
END;
$$;

-- Drop new infrastructure
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS has_role(UUID, app_role);
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_roles;
DROP TYPE IF EXISTS app_role;

## üìù **APPENDIX**

### **A. RLS Policy Quick Reference**

**Secure Role Management Pattern:**
```sql
-- Always use this pattern for admin checks
CREATE POLICY "policy_name" ON table_name
FOR operation USING (
  public.is_admin()  -- Uses secure has_role() function
);

-- NEVER do this (privilege escalation risk):
CREATE POLICY "policy_name" ON table_name
FOR operation USING (
  (SELECT role FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid()) = 'admin'
);
```

**Community Access Pattern:**
```sql
-- Balanced community + privacy
CREATE POLICY "policy_name" ON table_name
FOR SELECT USING (
  is_public_field = true  -- Public data
  OR owner_id = auth.uid()  -- Own data
  OR public.is_admin()  -- Admin access
);
```

### **B. Common RLS Errors & Solutions**

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "new row violates row-level security policy" | INSERT policy WITH CHECK fails | Review WITH CHECK clause conditions |
| "infinite recursion detected" | Policy references itself | Use SECURITY DEFINER function |
| "permission denied for table" | RLS enabled but no SELECT policy | Add SELECT policy for user role |
| "could not open relation with OID" | Policy references non-existent table | Check table name and schema |

### **C. Testing Checklist Template**

```markdown
## RLS Policy Test: [table_name]

### Positive Tests (Should Allow)
- [ ] Owner can SELECT own records
- [ ] Owner can UPDATE own records
- [ ] Owner can DELETE own records
- [ ] Admin can SELECT all records
- [ ] Admin can UPDATE all records
- [ ] Admin can DELETE all records
- [ ] [Role] can [action] [specific scenario]

### Negative Tests (Should Block)
- [ ] User cannot SELECT others' records
- [ ] User cannot UPDATE others' records
- [ ] User cannot DELETE others' records
- [ ] User cannot escalate privileges
- [ ] Non-admin cannot [admin action]

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Query executes in < [target]ms
- [ ] Index properly utilized
- [ ] No table scans in query plan
```

### **D. Migration Script Template**

```sql
-- Migration: [number]_[description].sql
-- Date: 2025-10-30
-- Phase: [1-4]
-- Story: MOBI-SEC-[ID]
-- Estimated Time: [X] minutes
-- Rollback: [number]_rollback_[description].sql

BEGIN;

-- Step 1: [Description]
-- Impact: [What changes]
[SQL statements]

-- Step 2: [Description]
-- Impact: [What changes]
[SQL statements]

-- Verification
DO $$
BEGIN
  -- Assert expected state
  IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT ...) THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Migration verification failed: ...';
  END IF;
  
  RAISE NOTICE 'Migration completed successfully';
END $$;

COMMIT;
```

## üéØ **FINAL NOTES & RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Critical Success Factors**

1. **Security First**: Do NOT skip Phase 1 - privilege escalation is a critical vulnerability
2. **Test Thoroughly**: RLS bugs can be subtle - comprehensive testing is essential
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Consider deploying phases 1-2 together, then 3-4 after validation
4. **Monitor Closely**: First 24 hours post-deployment are critical
5. **Team Training**: Ensure all developers understand new role management pattern

### **Future Enhancements**

After successful deployment, consider:
- Implement field-level RLS for sensitive profile data
- Add RLS policy caching for performance
- Create admin UI for role management
- Implement audit logging for admin actions
- Add rate limiting for security-sensitive operations

### **Risk Mitigation**

- ‚úÖ All migrations are transactional (can rollback)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive rollback scripts prepared
- ‚úÖ Testing covers security and functionality
- ‚úÖ Gradual deployment with checkpoints
- ‚úÖ Monitoring and alerting configured
