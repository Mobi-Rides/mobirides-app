**Problems Identified**:
- Database schema inconsistencies and foreign key chaos
- Component architecture failures in MessagingInterface.tsx
- Duplicate hook implementations causing conflicts
- Real-time subscriptions not working
- Message sending/receiving broken
- Conversation creation fails
- Incomplete RLS policies

**Required Work**:
- Phase 1 (Week 3): Database schema standardization
- Phase 2 (Weeks 4-5): Frontend hook consolidation
- Phase 3 (Week 6): Real-time implementation rebuild
- Phase 4 (Week 7): Testing and validation

**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Business Impact**: Users cannot communicate for booking coordination

**Reference Documents**:

**Timeline**: 1 week  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Business Impact**: Missing 15-30% revenue optimization

#### ⚠️ 4. Street-by-Street Navigation - 45% Complete (BASIC ONLY)

## ⚠️ Transparency Note

This report has been corrected to reflect the actual state of the platform. The original Week 2 report overstated progress by:
- Not mentioning insurance integration (0% complete)
- Not mentioning dynamic pricing non-integration (service exists but unused)
- Conflating notification fixes with messaging system functionality
- Not mentioning navigation system limitations
- Overstating overall system health (reported 75%, actual 62%)

Going forward, all reports will maintain this level of transparency to ensure accurate decision-making and realistic expectations.
