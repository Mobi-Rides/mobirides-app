# üîç **MOBIRIDES SYSTEM AUDIT REPORT**

**Date:** December 2024  
**Branch:** `admin-mapbox-handover-fixes-duma`  
**Overall System Health:** 70% Complete  

## üìã **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

MobiRides is a car-sharing platform built with React 18, TypeScript, and Supabase. The system provides comprehensive functionality for dual-role users (hosts/renters) with features spanning car management, bookings, messaging, payments, and verification. While the core business logic is well-implemented, several critical production-readiness gaps exist.

**Key Findings:**
- ‚úÖ **Strengths:** Modern architecture, comprehensive feature set, good developer experience
- ‚ùå **Critical Issues:** Mock payment system, incomplete file storage, dual message architectures
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Technical Debt:** Type safety inconsistencies, error handling gaps, transaction atomicity
